  <h2>About me</h2>
        <div id="aboutText">
            <p style="width:54vw;">My name is James Hannigan. I am a graduate of Computer Science at the University of Kent, in England. I am half English and half Irish.</p><img src="Images/profile.jpg" id="profilePic" alt="Profile Picture">
            <p style="width:54vw;">Since a very young age my interest for technology grew very quickly.</p>
            <p style="width:54vw;">Fortunately, my hard work during school paid off and I secured myself at a high ranking university. Throughout my time at university the main programming language I used was Java. But also used C++, Erlang. I also had the privilege of also learning web development languages such as; PHP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, AJAXs and XML.</p>
            <p style="width:54vw;">As well as, using MySQL and postgreSQL and other technologies such as; UNIX and CodeIgniter (MVC).</p>
            <p style="width:54vw;">In my own time, I have taken apart hardware, made animations, illustrations, videos, software and websites.</p>
            <p>Another hobby of mine is photography. I regularly go out and capture landscapes, along with other things. Then I enjoy edited the photographs I've taken. If you're interesting in seeing my photographs, use this link by <a target="_blank" href="http://jameshanniganphotos.000webhostapp.com/index.php">clicking here</a>.</p>
            <p>Unrelated to my aspirations I also take part in sport, I regularly go to the gym, hiking, rock climbing, cycling, swimming and play basketball. This is all an attempt to keep up a healthy lifestyle.</p>
            <p>When I am not using my time productively, I like to relax by reading, cooking or watching television. I am also a very sociable person and enjoy spending time with my family and friends.</p>
            <p>To read more about my professional life please refer to the <a href="resume.html">R&eacute;sum&eacute;</a> page on this website.
