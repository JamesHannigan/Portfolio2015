  <h2>About me</h2>
        <div id="aboutText">
            <p style="width:54vw;">My name is James Hannigan. I am currently studying Computer Science at the University of Kent, in England. I am half English and half Irish.</p><img src="Images/profile.jpg" id="profilePic" alt="Profile Picture">
            <p style="width:54vw;">Since a very young age my interest for technology grew very quickly. Now I am at university learning about my interest.</p>
            <p style="width:54vw;">Fortunately, my hard work during school paid off and I secured myself at a high ranking university. During my first year at university I had a full two terms of learning Java. I also had the privilege of learning web development languages such as; HTML, CSS, JavaScript, MySQL and PHP.</p>
            <p style="width:54vw;">In my own time, I have taken apart hardware, made animations, illustrations, videos, software and websites.</p>
            <p>Unrelated to my aspirations I also take part in sport, I regularly go to the gym, swimming training and play basketball. This is all an attempt to keep up a healthy lifestyle.</p>
            <p>When I am not using my time productively, I like to relax by watching movies, television shows and playing video games. I am also a very sociable person and enjoy spending time with my family and friends.</p>
            <p>To read more about my professional life please refer to the <a href="resume.html">R&eacute;sum&eacute;</a> page on this website.
